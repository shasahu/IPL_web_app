IPL Analysis
--------------------------
This is a highlevel description which will naturally evolve. It is like a goal post, and try to explore and build parts that you find more exciting, the full system need not be complete. But it is in a competition mode with community evaluation.


Basic problem statement:
........................
1. You are given IPL dataset.
2. This dataset consists of two seperate CSV files : matches and deliveries. These files contain the information of each match summary and ball by ball details, respectively (you are also eligible to add more data).
3. You need to store data in database and read from there.
2. You need to do the relevant preprocessing and analysis on the given data and show the visualization of the outputs.
3. You need to create a dashboard that shows all the visualization part.
4. Users need to login and can see the different visualizations.
5. You need to do the analysis of data and answer the following questions:-
	5.1. For each team you need to give the stadium name(venue) where that team have won the maximum match?
	5.2. For anyone match, you need to show the total runs scored by each batsman in that match and how they dismissed.
	5.3. For anyone match, you need to show the total wicktes taken by all bowlers in that match.
	5.4. For year 2019, you need to show top 10 batsman(rank them according to their total runs scored).
	5.5. For year 2019, you need to show top 10 bowlers(rank them according to their total wickets taken).
	5.6. You need to show that does winning toss increases the chance of victory.
	5.7. For any 10 batsman, you need to show, against which bowler he got out most number of time.
6. After login, users will be provided option to choose between bowlers or batsman to show the above stats.




Technical aspects that must be present
.......................................  
1. User login (for website)
2. Cleaning and preprocessing of data (if required)
3. Visualizing the output
4. Statistical analysis 
5. User interaction



External tools and libraries can be used
........................................
1. For visualization and user input 
2. For website (if done)
3. For Dashboard
4. For any other tools we need to discuss and check as they may depend on the approach of the teams




Deliverables
............
1. System (website is optional but contain bonus)
2. Report (Follow software engineering priciples. Starts from requirement then design, then develop, testing and finally integration and deployment)
3. Demo (can be a video or slides containing most important parts of the project, this may contain non-technical aspects too.)
Remember that the proportion of content on various parts in report and demo determine the focus and effort of the teams.

Evaluation
..............
1. Demo 10  
2. Report 5
3. Interview 5 (individual)

Scores will be collected from all other teams, external judge, and instructor on the demo part and then a weighted average will be calculated with weights as: instructor 0.5, other teams 0.3 external 0.2
